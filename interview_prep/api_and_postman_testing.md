# What is an API & How to Test it with Postman

This document explains what an API is in a simple, easy-to-understand way and provides a practical guide on how to test the MERN Estate project's API using Postman.

## Part 1: What is an API? (Explained in Simple Language)

Imagine you are at a restaurant.

*   You, the **customer**, are the **Client**. In our project, this is the **React front-end** running in your web browser.
*   The **kitchen**, which prepares your food, is the **Server**. In our project, this is the **Node.js/Express application** and the **MongoDB database**.

You, the customer, don't go directly into the kitchen to get your food. That would be chaotic and inefficient. Instead, you have a **waiter**.

The waiter is the **API (Application Programming Interface)**.

Hereâ€™s how the waiter (API) works:

1.  **You have a Menu (The API Contract):** The menu tells you what you can order and what you need to provide for each order. An API has a "contract" that defines what requests can be made. In our project, the routes files (e.g., `auth.route.js`) define this contract.

2.  **You Make a Request:** You tell the waiter, "I would like to order a burger." You are making a structured request. In API terms, this is an **HTTP Request**. You specify:
    *   What you want to do: **Order food** (This is the **HTTP Method**, like `POST` to create something).
    *   What you want: **A burger** (This is the **Endpoint**, like `/api/listings`).
    *   Any special instructions: **"No onions, please"** (This is the **Request Body** or **Parameters**, like `{ "onions": false }`).

3.  **The Waiter Takes it to the Kitchen:** The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (Server). The waiter knows exactly how to talk to the kitchen staff.

4.  **The Kitchen Prepares the Order:** The kitchen (Server) processes the request. It gets the ingredients (data from the MongoDB database), follows the recipe (business logic in the controllers), and prepares your burger.

5.  **The Waiter Brings it Back:** The waiter (API) brings the food back to your table. This is the **HTTP Response**. The response contains:
    *   **The food you ordered** (The **Response Body**, usually in JSON format, like `{ "listing": { ... } }`).
    *   **A status**: The waiter might say, "Here is your order" (a `200 OK` status) or "Sorry, we are out of burgers" (a `404 Not Found` status).

**In short, an API is a messenger that takes requests from a client, tells a system (the server) what to do, and then returns the response back to the client.** It allows different software applications to talk to each other in a standardized way without having to know the complex internal details of each other.

## Part 2: How to Test the MERN Estate API with Postman

Postman is a tool that lets you act as the client and send HTTP requests directly to your back-end API, without needing the front-end. This is extremely useful for testing and debugging.

**Base URL:** For local testing, your server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 1. Testing User Signup (Creating a new user)

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup`
*   **Action:** Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and choose **JSON** from the dropdown.
*   **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "username": "testuser",
        "email": "testuser@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

*   **To Test:** Click the **Send** button. You should get a `201 Created` status and a message like `"User created Successfully"`.

### 2. Testing User Sign-in (Authenticating a user)

This is the most important step for testing protected routes. When you sign in, the server will send back an `access_token` in a cookie. Postman automatically saves this cookie and will send it with future requests to the same domain.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin`
*   **Action:** Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and choose **JSON**.
*   **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "email": "testuser@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

*   **To Test:** Click **Send**. You should get a `200 OK` status and the user's data in the response body. Postman will now have the authentication cookie.

### 3. Testing a Protected Route (e.g., Creating a Listing)

Now that you have signed in (and Postman has the cookie), you can test routes that require authentication.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/listing/create`
*   **Action:** Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and choose **JSON**.
*   **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Cozy Cottage",
        "description": "A beautiful cottage in the woods.",
        "address": "123 Forest Lane",
        "regularPrice": 250,
        "discountPrice": 200,
        "bathrooms": 2,
        "bedrooms": 3,
        "furnished": true,
        "parking": true,
        "type": "rent",
        "offer": true,
        "imageUrls": [],
        "userRef": "<paste-the-user-id-from-signin-response-here>"
    }
    ```
    *(Note: You get the `userRef` ID from the body of the successful sign-in response.)*

*   **To Test:** Click **Send**. If you are properly authenticated, you will get a `201 Created` status and the new listing object in the response.

### 4. Testing User Sign-out

This will clear the authentication cookie.

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signout`
*   **To Test:** Click **Send**. You should get a `200 OK` status. If you try to create a listing again after this, it will fail with a `401 Unauthorized` error because the cookie has been cleared.
